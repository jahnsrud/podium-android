## What's this?
Part 2 of my exam in PGR202 Android Development at HÃ¸yskolen Kristiania in the Spring of 2019. 
The task was to create an app where you self decided the concept. 
The exam had some clear guidelines which you can read more about in "PGR202 - Exam.pdf"

## Comments
The app is obviously flawed, but the core concept came nicely along. 
It works great as a prototype and could absolutely be further improved. 
There are lots of things that are not/partly working, including episode parsing. 

Even with all its flaws, I'm happy with the result for being my second Android 
app in a short timespan. If I had more time, I would continue to improve 
the core functionality, adding animations, improved discoverability of 
new podcasts, and much more.
